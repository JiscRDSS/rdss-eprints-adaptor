Through analysis and data analysis from selected operators , it is shown that mobile operators achieve as money flow handlers levels of efficiency , profitability ,and risk control comparable with deposit banks – Furthermore , the payment infrastructures deployed by both are found to be quite similar , and  are analyzed in relation to  strategic challenges and opportunities This paves the way to either mobile operators taking a bigger role ,or for banks to tie up such operators to them even more tightly ,or for alliances/mergers to take place ,all these options being subject to regulatory evolution as analyzed as well . The reader should acknowledge that  there is no emphasis on specific  Mobile banking (M-Banking) technologies (security, terminals, application software) , nor on related market forces from the user demand point of view.</dc:description>
